          Undermine is a groundbreaking two-day conference dedicated to the rapidly emerging field of hashrate heating, harnessing Bitcoin miners to power electric heating infrastructure. 
          The Hashrate Heatpunks are a group of bitcoiners undermining the status-quo. Mining doesn't have to be centralized in pub-co mega facilities or massive mining pools - and home hashing doesn't have to be exclusive to the ideologically motivated. Instead, we can bring mining to all via heating appliances and home devices. 
        </p>
        <p class="text-lg mt-4 text-left md:text-justify text-black px-4 md:px-4 lg:px-10">
          As the Bitcoin mining industry undergoes a transformative phase, the potential to unlock additional utility through heating has become clear.
          The 2025 Heatpunk Summit brings together the brightest minds and hands-on builders, tinkerers, plebs, engineers, tradespeople, contractors, and companies to collaborate on advancing home mining.
          By leveraging Bitcoin miners for heating, we can decentralize network hashrate, lower utility costs, and accelerate Bitcoin adoption as a neutral monetary asset.
        </p>
        <p class="text-lg mt-4 text-left md:text-justify text-black px-4 md:px-4 lg:px-10">
          Join us in shaping the future of energy and Bitcoin at the forefront of this exciting new industry.
